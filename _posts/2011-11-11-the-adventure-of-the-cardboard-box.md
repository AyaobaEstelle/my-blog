## MY ZURI EXPERIENCE

Hello my name is Esther but my friends call me Ayaoba. Towards the end of my National Youth Service (a program designed to enable every Nigerian graduate to serve their fathers land) I heard about the Ingressive for Good +Zuri scholarship and what they do is they basically introduce you to software development and design aimed at complete beginners which anyone can join. And I decided to enroll for Frontend Development.

I registered for the scholarship and  a few weeks later I got the acceptance mail and I was so excited to begin another phase of my life. I got into the workspace and the first two weeks was mainly for introduction and getting to know other students and the mentors.. During that same period my immediate elder brother bought me a course at Udemy ``The complete web developer in 2022 zero to mastery‚Äù. The first three tasks were  general tasks for all the  students to get familiar with the workspace, then the very first task for frontend development was to state the meaning of Html and list the different types of  html tags both container and empty tags. The task helped me to understand the difference between tags that needed to be closed and self closing tags.


Moving on to the next task where I had to write an actual html code for the first time and I kinda enjoyed it because with the description of the task,what i had learnt from Udemy videos and with the knowledge gained from the previous task about tags gave me an idea of what to do and how to do it. I discovered  a website called W3C and I loved it, it's just so easy to understand and learn from. I learned about codepen and some CSS with another task where I got to  build my first  HTML table. Using Replit  I learnt how to link pages when I built a simple HTML and CSS-driven website. When I got the task for javascript I knew immediately that the work had just begun. The first task was to build an alert javascript calculator. I learnt how to use VS code, and Sublime text. I also got to know about git and Github, Bootstrap and many other websites.
As we progressed in the training and I got to successfully complete more tasks I  found out  that it did not only satisfy my original motive for enrolling, it also opened my eyes to understand the benefit of Software Development as a whole and I loved every bit of it.
